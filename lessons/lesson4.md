### The Mission

Imagine the duties of a dump truck.  They often follow the same path, while also picking up and dropping things off at constant intervals.  This time, we'll be working on getting the bot to follow a predictable path.  Once that is working, your job is to use the claw on the front of your bots to pick up and drop off the cargo.  This way, we'll have a functioning dump/delivery truck.

### Tasks

Your job is to create a delivery route for your dump truck. Using the claw, we want to pick up the
object in the designated 'pick up' zone and drop it off in the 'drop off' zone.  The route for your dump truck makes a square shape.

For your first pickup route, you only need to pick up the object at the start of your route and
drop it off at the end of the route!

**1)** Make the robot move in a square using the movement and steering control blocks.  (It will
take some trial and error to get a perfect 90 degree turn. Or, you can use the my block that we
provide you)

To make things exciting, make sure your square is at least two feet in length & width!

**2)** Once that is working, think about how you can add the 'pick up' and 'drop off' features
using the claw. (Hint, use the my blocks that we provide you)

**2.1)** Can you make your dump truck pick up the object, move in a square, and then drop off the
object ?  Try it out.

**3)** Now, what if your boss tells you that you need to travel this route more than once? Well,
this is where the 'loop block' comes in handy.  It lets you execute a set of blocks over and over
again.  Check out the cheat sheet we provide you for more info on the loop block.

Experiment with the loop block, see if you can make the bot travel in the square shape several times without failure.  Or, try making the loop stop after a certain amount of time.  Or, if you're feeling crazy, make it go on forever!

**4)**  Can you make the bots travel in a shape other than a square? A triangle? Pentagon? Hexagon?  Try coming up with a new delivery route shape for the dump truck.  Or, even harder, in the shape of an infinity symbol?

### Challenges

**5)** What if someone forgot to place an object in the pick up zone?  Well, you can use the infrared sensor from last week to detect whether there is an object that needs to be picked up.  (Look into using the case block)

**6)**  What if there is an obstacle that prevents you from moving in your path?  Can you make the bot stop so that it does not collide with the object.  Or, even better, make it so that the bot goes around an obstacle?
