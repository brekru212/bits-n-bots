### The Task
Make the robot move in a square using the loop block.
First make the robot move forward.
Then, make the robot turn 90 degrees - (actually hard to get right with the control blocks, so play around with the turning values until you find the right one)
Finally, put those steps into a loop block and have it execute 4 times in a row to complete the square. 

### Challenges
If the groups finish early, have them try different stopping conditions. Instead of stopping after turning four times, try:
- stopping after 20 seconds of moving in squares
- stopping after 20 seconds, but making sure that the robot always completes a full square (hint: you can put loops inside of other loops)
- doing a loop in one direction and then a loop in another direction.
- Try out the other stopping mechanisms in the loop block- get creative!
- stopping if the infrared sensor sees something within 25 units (unclear what the units are in the block)
- try to get the robot to do the infinity sign over and over
