Motion is Fun:

This project is meant to introduce the movement/steering blocks.

Task:

Make the robot move forward for two rotations of the motor.

Then, once this is working, make the robot reverse back to its original position

Finally, add a cheering sound to congratulate yourself

Challenges:
	Use a loop block to make the robot move back and forth 5 different times.  
	If the robot is bumped, you should make it stop moving and play a not so happy sound
