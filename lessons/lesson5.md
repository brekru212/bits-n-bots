TEMPORARY LESSON DESCRIPTION.  I wrote this real quick after we came up with this lesson on Saturday 1/16, will refine it in the near future.

Lesson Five
------------
Dump Truck: Navigate

With this lesson, the point is to demonstrate the use of 'case structures'.  This is Lego's equivalent of an 'if statement'.

An if statement is very common in programming, it is what allows the robots to think for themselves.  Here's an example:

If the robot is too close to a wall:

  -  turn around and keep moving

If the robot is not too close:

  -  keep moving forward

*** Now, show a demonstration of the anatomy of the switch block.  No more than two minutes.***

We're going to use this idea to tell our robots to navigate an obstacle course.  

This will require the robots to move rather gracefully.  

First, the robot will move forward.  Then, it will have to check the value of the Infrared Sensor.  Remember, this is the sensor
that we use to figure out if we are too close to an object.

Now, this is where our if-statement comes in handy (it is called a switch by EV3).  Depending on how close you are to an obstacle, you either
move around it or continue moving forward.

Good luck!
