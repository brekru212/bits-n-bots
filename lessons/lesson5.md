The mission
===
We want our robot to think for itself.  Help it navigate around the obstacles!

Task
---
 Without knocking any of them over, our robot needs to navigate the obstacles that it encounters.

Using movement blocks and anything else that you have learned from previous weeks, try to make this happen.

Hint: The easiest way is to use a variety of movement blocks

This is how your robot should behave:
 - If the robot is too close to a wall: move around it and keep moving
 - Otherwise, keep moving forward


Once this works, try rearragning your obstacles and solving the problem again!

Challenges
---

Whew! Just getting your robot through the maze is a great task; however if you're craving more:

1. What about using the proximity sensor? When the proximity sensor value is very small, we know that the robot is close to an obstacle and needs to turn.  Can you try and implement this?

Hint: This involves constantly checking the proximity sensor and using it to decide how to move your robot!

This is a hard challenge, call over a volunteer if you need some help!

Good luck!
