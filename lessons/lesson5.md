The mission
===
We want our robot to think for itself.  Help it navigate around the obstacles!

Task
---
 Without knocking any obstacles over, our robot needs to go around the obstacles that it finds.

Using movement blocks and anything else that you have learned from previous weeks, try to make this happen.

Hint: The easiest way is to use a bunch of movement blocks

This is how your robot should move:
 - If the robot is too close to a wall: move around it and keep moving
 - Otherwise, keep moving forward


Once this works, try moving your obstacles and solve the problem again!

Challenges
---

Whew! Just getting your robot through the maze is a great task; however if you're craving more:

1. What about using the proximity sensor? When the proximity sensor value is very small, we know that the robot is close to an obstacle and needs to turn.  Can you try and do this?

Hint: This involves checking the proximity sensor over and over again and using its value to decide how to move your robot!

This is a hard challenge, call over a volunteer if you need some help!

Good luck!
