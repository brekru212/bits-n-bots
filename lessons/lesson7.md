The mission
===

We want our robot to be able to trace its path on paper.  What cool shapes can you come up with?

### Task
 Welcome back to part two of the marker mission!
 
 1. We drew some letters last week. How about drawing the first letters from each of your names?
 
 Example: If Thurston and Chloe are working together, draw an 'T' and a 'C'!
 
 2. Now, lets try drawing a six-pointed star. There is an easy and a hard way to do this! Think about it (hint, it involves two triangles)

..* Work with another team to draw the star with two different triangles in different colors.

..* Can you get both robots to work on the star at the same time without crashing?  Where should they start?  Will they need to wait for each other?

#### Loop
 
 You may have seen the loop block a few weeks ago, don't worry if you haven't, you can do this with or without loops:
 
 In math, there is something called the 'cosine function'.  When you graph it, it looks like this:

 Try using the loop block to control how many times you draw each 'segment' (Hint: use the count option)
   
   
#### Challenge
 Lets try to draw some nested squares

### Easy Approach #1:
 
 Draw each square, one at a time.  So run the program once, change the 'size' of the square in your program, run it again.
 
### Hard Approach #2:
 
 Use the loop block to repeatedly draw squares, but changing the size of each square to be smaller than the previous one.  You'll need to move the robot between each square.
 Think about how you can use the loop block to accomplish this task, and ask a mentor if you get stuck.

 
If you make it this far, you are free to try drawing anything you can come up with!
 
Good luck!
