The happy dog: "runs" towards a person. (e.g. if a person is farther away from the infrared sensor the bot goes faster, if a person is closer it slows down)Added challenge. Avoids walls using the sight, and turns away so it doesn't crash. Added challenge: simultaneously reacts to being touched (touch sensor or buttons).

Goal: Student learns the behaviour of linear responses

Bot: Traker

Functions: Freeze (pauses when touched), Turn-90Â° (to avoid walls)

Sensor: distance/infrared (touch)
