NOTE: Couldn't test the full lesson because of a missing sensor. Still deciding where to take this lesson.  It might be fine to just use the single proximity sensor.

Working with sensors:

The goal for this proejct is to get used to using the various sensors that come with ev3 to control the actions of the bot.

Task:  Make the robot respond to its surroundings.  If something gets too close to it, the display screen should display "Too Close!", or emits a sound of your choice.

Then, do the same thing, but with the Sound Sensor (If we eventually get it)


Challenges:
	Make the bot move around and explore its surroundings in a pattern of your choice. (Circle, square, zig zag)
