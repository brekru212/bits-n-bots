This lesson is different than what is listed on the timeline document on google docs.  Because we do not have the truck bot, we came up with our own lesson that could eventually be used with the truck bot if/when we get once.

Task:  Learn to use a for loop to complete the same task over and over again.
(Loop Block)

Use a for loop to make the bot move around in a square.

First, make the bot move forward and turn ninety degrees.  Once this is working, you can put this into a loop block! To make a square, you just have to repeat the move and turns steps four times (one for each side of the square)

HINT: You will have to play around with the turn/motor power numbers to get a perfect right angle turn

Once this works, see if you can control the number of times the robot moves in a square.  Once it reaches this number, end the loop display a cheering sound.

Challenge (If we get the truck bot):
	Load and unload at each corner
