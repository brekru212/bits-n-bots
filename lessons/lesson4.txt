Introduction

This lesson is different than what is listed on the timeline document on google docs.  Because we do not have the truck bot, we came up with our own lesson that could eventually be used with the truck bot if/when we get once.

**Task**:  Learn to use a while loop to complete the same task over and over again, which is to make deliveries as a dump truck.
This will make you more comfortable with moving the bot, while also demonstrating a 'loop block'

Make the bot move in a square.  Think about the best ways to do this

This will take some trial and error to get right because the bots turn differently depending on the surface they are on!  So, play around with the power settings of the motors.

Now, use a 'loop block' to make the bot move in a square over and over again.  
(If you didn't get to the challenges last week, don't worry, we'll explain what a loop block is again.)




Once this works, see if you can control the number of times the robot moves in a square.  Once it reaches this number, end the loop and display a cheering sound.

Challenge:
	Now, make the robot pick up and drop off an object at each corner of the square.
