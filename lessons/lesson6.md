The mission
===
We want our robot to be able to trace its path on paper.  What cool shapes can you come up with?

Task
---
 As you may have noticed, there is now a pen on your robot! Using the paper, try drawing these shapes:
 
 1) The letter L, or something else from our alphabet
 
 2) In honor of pi day last week, try drawing the greek letter pi (pronounced like pie)!
 
 Here is what it looks like:

 3)  Now, try drawing a shape.  Draw a circle and then try drawing a square.
 
Loop
---
 
 You may have seen the loop block a few weeks ago, don't worry if you haven't.
 
 Lets try to draw a zig-zag.

Think about how you can use the loop block to draw 4 zig zags. How about 5 zig zags? 
(Hint: use the 'count' option on the loop block!)
 
 
 Now, what about some fancy shapes?
 
How about a square wave.  Can you try to draw this?

 How about something with round edges? Come up with your own ideas.
 
Good luck!
