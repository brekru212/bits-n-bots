### What is a Template Block?

A template block is a custom block (my-block is EV3) that performs some composite functionality.  In essence, it is how we are attempting to make each lesson 'stand alone' so that students are not hindered by their lack of knowledge of preivous lesson topics.

An example is the 'clawPickup' my-block.  This performs all the needed operations to open a claw
attachment and close it again without forcing the students to struggle with the difficulties of finding the
correct motor value to perform the task.

So, in subsequent lessons, we would provide these my-blocks and let the students continue on with
the lesson at hand.




Please put all template blocks for each lesson in their own subdirectory
